/**
 * Deploys the ForgeableERC1155 and TokenForge contracts, then sets
 * the forging contract address in ForgeableERC1155.
 *
 * Original notes from Scaffold-ETH:
 * - On localhost, the deployer account is the one that comes with Hardhat, which is already funded.
 * - When deploying to live networks (e.g. `yarn deploy --network sepolia`), the deployer account
 *   should have sufficient balance to pay for gas fees for contract creation.
 * - You can generate a random account with `yarn generate` or `yarn account:import` to import your
 *   existing PK which will fill DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY_ENCRYPTED in the .env file (then used on hardhat.config.ts).
 * - You can run the `yarn account` command to check your balance in every network.
 *
 * New Comments:
 * - We provide a base URI for our ERC1155 token's metadata (with `{id}` in the URI).
 * - After deploying both contracts, we call `setForgingContract(...)` so that TokenForge
 *   is recognized as the contract that can call `forgeMint` and `forgeBurn` on the ERC1155.
